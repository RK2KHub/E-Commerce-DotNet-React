# Stationery Web Application

This repository contains a .NET Core and React-based web application for managing a stationery shop. It includes the back-end server (ASP.NET Core) and the front-end (React.js).

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- .NET 6.0 or later
- Node.js (for the React front-end)
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StationeryWebApp.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies for both the .NET back-end and the React front-end:

```bash
# For .NET back-end
dotnet restore

# For React front-end (navigate to the ClientApp folder)
cd ClientApp
npm install
```

### 3. Build and Run the Application

To run the application, first build the .NET back-end and then start the React front-end.

```bash
# Build and run the .NET back-end
dotnet build
dotnet run

# Open a new terminal, navigate to the ClientApp folder, and start the React front-end
cd ClientApp
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000` for the back-end API and `http://localhost:3000` for the React front-end.

## Git Best Practices

### Ignore Unnecessary Files

Before committing the code to GitHub, ensure that unnecessary files like Visual Studio temporary files, build results, and other local files are ignored.

#### Step 1: Create a `.gitignore` file

In the root directory of your project, create a `.gitignore` file (if it doesn't already exist).

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

#### Step 2: Add the following lines to `.gitignore` to ignore build and temp files

```bash
# Ignore Visual Studio temporary files, build results, and files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons.
.vs/
bin/
obj/
ClientApp/node_modules/

# Ignore environment variables
*.env
```

### Common Git Commands

- **Add all files to the staging area:**
  
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```

- **Commit changes with a message:**

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

- **Push changes to GitHub:**

  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

### Handling Permission Errors

If you encounter a `Permission denied` error while committing files, it is likely because Visual Studio's temporary files or other directories like `.vs/` or `bin/` are being tracked by Git. These files should be ignored.

#### Fix:

1. **Update your `.gitignore` file to exclude the `.vs/` folder and other temporary files** (as shown above).
   
2. **Remove `.vs` folder from Git cache:**

   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached .vs
   ```

3. **Add all files again:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit and push your changes:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Exclude .vs folder and temp files from Git"
   git push
   ```
